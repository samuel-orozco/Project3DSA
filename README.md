Project 3 for DSA: COVID-19 data tracker
Team Name: Hydroxychloroqueens

Team Members: Caden Trca, Mackenzie Fileman, Samuel Orozco

Project Title: COVID by County

Problem: Create a data structure that quickly and accurately analyses data from COVID-19
cases across the United States by county, and population size, facilitating the retrieval of virus
related data when looking up a specific county.

Motivation: In order to efficiently analyze and track COVID hotspots across the United States
Data Structures must be made in order to parse and order all the case data coming in by county
every day. Having a DS that does this quickly and accurately can help medical personnel and
the government know where and when to send help to a specific location. Testing multiple
different data structures will allow us to choose which one works the best.

Features: We will know when we have solved the problem when we compare the two data
structures and we find out which one prints out reliable data the quickest. We will also know
when we have solved the problem when we reach a solution that with one simple input can give
us various data points and information regarding COVID cases in a specific county.

Data: We will be using a COVID-19 case data repository that updates daily based off of data
given by the CDC. https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/master/us-counties.csv 

Tools: We will be coding this entire project in C++. We will also be using Excel, powerpoint, and
Procreate (for images, logos, and aesthetics)

Strategy:This project will be split into two main Data Structures: BST trees and an unordered
Hash Map. BST trees will have several algorithms implemented with them such as search
functions and inorder traversals. We will also be implementing algorithms that iterates through
the data, adds it together, and groups it in order to easily implement it in a tree or hash map.

Distribution of Responsibility and Roles:
Caden- BST Trees, Figuring out how to parse the data
Mackenzie- Hash Map, Logo Building
Sam- BST Trees, Figuring out how to bring in county pictures to the program, Final Presentation
